Build & Run
----

This will build the default targets (the library and the CLI program):

```console
$ dune build
```

This will run the CLI program:

```console
$ dune exec irsim_cli [args]
```

This will install the program to the home directory (the binary is called `irsim_cli`):

```console
$ dune build @install
$ dune build install
```

The GUI is being worked on.
